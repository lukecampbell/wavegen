R19
main.c:Changed from calling malloc() in main() to allocate for the two channel Waveform structs to using g_slice_new(Waveform).  
gtkmethods.c:120 properly typecasted app->vscale1 to a GtkRange whereas before it was a GtkWidget being sent to a function that handles gtk_ranges.  It was an almost irrelevent change but the compiler warnings are gone now.

R15
Major Revision
Added a GTK GUI to the Wave Generator, 
Still adding more to the gui.  MAJOR MAJOR improvements and changes

R14
Completely redid wavegen to add some level of scalability, and soon I can add more layers like interfaces, I will eventually get to it.  
See waveGen.h for all the defined waveforms.

Now the developers can easily scale this by passing a new struct to the functions and fillChannel().  

R?
Just ensuring that I still maintain this project, I really need to get some time and go through this and add stuff.

R4
I added all the basic files to wavPlayer and riff, still in pre-alpha stage...

Added complex capabilities for future FFT

R8 I think...
PCM.c and PCM.h
The structure pcmSettings' sample rate variable was called sampleRate not samplerate so I replaced the two strings to allow it to compile.

Changed the makefiles, added doxygen to riff, decentralized riff into a library libriff2, added LGPL to libriff2.
